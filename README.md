# Stereo Visual Odometry

## Description
This repository contains python code for performing visual odometry from stereo images for precise localization of autonomous vehicles and robots. It processes stereo imagery to provide reliable, real-time motion tracking for navigating complex environments.

## Files
- `run_kitti.py`: This script performs visual odometry on images from the KITTI dataset.
- `run_realsense.py`: This script performs visual odometry using video streams from a RealSense d435i camera.
- `StereoVisualOdom.py`: This contains a the StereoVisualOdometry class, which processes stereo camera images to compute visual odometry, providing essential functionalities for motion tracking and environment mapping.
